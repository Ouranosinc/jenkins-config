Presentation at Canadian Research Software Conference on May 28, 2019.

2:00 â€“ 2:05 PM | Lightning Talk: Jenkins Configuration as Code

    Long Vu, Software Developer | Ouranos

    Configuring a Jenkins continuous build/integration server has typically been a manual task of clicking through the Web UI.  This means it is hard to keep multiple existing Jenkins instances (Production/Staging) in sync configuration-wise, and it is hard to start a fresh new Jenkins instance fully configured from the get-go.  This talk will demonstrate the new Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin, allowing you to start up a fully configured Jenkins. See: https://github.com/Ouranosinc/jenkins-config
